- 👋 Hi, I’m @DenisWm
- 👀 I’m interested in... trying to develop things that will blow my mind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... JAVA, learning, FAST learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't know yet, but I'm getting into it.
- 📫 How to reach me... {@denismamoni} {+55 69 9 8466-3585} {denismamoni@hotmail.com}
- Sincerely... There is something bothering me, my job situation isn't good. So I decide to learn new things trying to change my life. 
I'm learning JAVA from scratch and I just had contatc with developing in the beggining of my graduation in Civil Enginner many many years ago wich I graduated.
For sure I like it a lot and looking foward to reach higher levels of coding and knoledge in this field. I learn fast, really fast, I know this because most of the exemples given by the teacher I got the same solution as his. 
It makes me very happy, knowing that I'm improving. I'm Brazilian but my english is very good though. 
I wrote this without any help, by the way I finish Duoling in a single day xDxD.
I enjoy the idea of being a developer, working from home is a very interesting. Anyway, looking forward to see how it gonna be.
I'm new here on GitHub, my expectation are very high and my seek of knowledge are even higher. And before everything I would like to thank in advance all everyone who will help me, directly or indirectly in this journey. Appreciate all of you guys, from this gorgeous community.
